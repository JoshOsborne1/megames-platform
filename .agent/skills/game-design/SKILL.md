# Game Design Skill

This skill provides principles for creating engaging and balanced games for the PartyPack platform.

## 1. The Core Loop (30-Second Test)

Every game should have a satisfying 30-second loop:

1. **Action**: The player makes a move (e.g., picks a color, writes a clue).
2. **Feedback**: The game responds immediately (glow, sound, visual change).
3. **Reward**: The player gets points, social validation, or game progress.

## 2. Player Psychology (Bartle Taxonomy)

Design for multiple types of players:

- **Achievers**: Provide scores, badges, and leaderboards.
- **Explorers**: Add hidden mechanics or varied game modes.
- **Socializers**: Focus on interaction, chat, and collaborative play.
- **Killers**: Ensure competition is fair and intense.

## 3. Difficulty & Flow

- **Flow State**: Keep the challenge level matching the player's skill.
- **Onboarding**: The first round should be dead simple to hook the player.
- **Rest Beats**: Provide moments of lower intensity between high-stress rounds.

## 4. Multiplayer Balance

- **Catch-up Mechanics**: Ensure losing players still feel they have a chance (e.g., double points in the final round).
- **Anti-Griefing**: Prevent single players from stalling the game (use timers).

## 5. Anti-Patterns

- ** Isolation**: Don't design mechanics that ignore the other players.
- **Excessive Punishment**: Avoid losing progress; instead, slow down gain.
- **Ambiguity**: The goal of every turn should be 100% clear.
